Description: CorMut provides functions for computing kaks for
        individual sites or specific amino acids and detecting
        correlated mutations among them. Three methods are provided for
        detecting correlated mutations ,including conditional selection
        pressure, mutual information and Jaccard index. The computation
        consists of two steps: First, the positive selection sites are
        detected; Second, the mutation correlations are computed among
        the positive selection sites. Note that the first step is
        optional. Meanwhile, CorMut facilitates the comparison of the
        correlated mutations between two conditions by the means of
        correlated mutation network.
